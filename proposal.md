## 1. Predicting Diamond Prices
* As someone who recently got engaged and am at the age where all my friends are also getting engaged, I thought it would be fun to do a project on diamonds. When I was doing research on diamonds, the 4 C's were consistently mentioned. While ideally maximizing all 4C's sounds like the right way to search for the perfect diamond, the pricing didn't always seem to align - diamonds with identical 4C's were selling for noticeably different prices. Clearly, pricing goes beyond the 4C's, and many other factors contribute to the final price. This project will aim to idenitify what factors help drive the price of diamonds. What determines the price of a diamond?
* Data: While there are other sources aggregate diamond prices from different vendors, I wanted to create a webscraper for [Blue Nile](https://www.bluenile.com/) since that is where I got my engagement ring from. 

## 2. Running Stats
* Purpose: While I'm not an avid runner, I do frequently run 5Ks/10Ks/half marathons. I find it fascinating what our bodies can do and how mentally taxing running longer distances can be. For this project it would be interesting to explore competitive running and what factors affect run time.

## 3. Predicting Movie Ratings
* Purpose: What makes a "good" movie? Do certain actors/actresses or directors "signal" a good movie? Do certain movies consistently rate better? This project will explore what affects movie ratings. To predict user rating based on movie information.
* Data [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)/ Movie Database (IMDb Alternative) API: consists of many different attributes about movies. For example, movie title, genre, actors/actresses, directors, company, year, etc.
